### Installing

If you have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) on your system, you can simply install or upgrade the Python bindings:

```python
pip install selenium
pip install fpdf
```



### Drivers

Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Firefox, for example, requires [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases), which needs to be installed before the below examples can be run.  Make sure itâ€™s in your PATH, so for example place *geckdriver.exe* in *C:\Users\myname\PycharmProjects\WikiScrape\venv\Scripts*.

### Input

Only Wikipedia links.
